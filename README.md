# Task_Board

## Description
This project was created for practice with elements that can be manipulated through creating a place to enter and arrange tasks by status, color coded with proximity to due date.

## Usage
The page starts out with blank three rows and an Add Task button above. Once clicked, a user can enter a Title, Due Date, and Description of their tasks. If the task is due today, it will be yellow. If the task is overdue, the task will be red. Once created, the tasks can be dragged and dropped across the page to be set for the appropriate column.
